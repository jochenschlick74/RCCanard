# RCCanard

this project is intended to provide python code that impleents Dieter Schalls formulas to engineer RC canard planes.
The basic set of formulas was published in the 1980 in a German book named

Dieter Schall: Entwerfen und Fliegen von Entenflugmodellen. Villingen-Schwenningen : Neckar-Verlag, 1986

Up to now this archive only contains the basic definitions and tests. Nothing particulary useful.

## Setup (MacOS) 
1. python3 -m venv env
2. source env/bib/activate 
3. pip install --upgrade pip
4. pip install -r requirements.txt
